        Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15. He won the Mr. Universe title at 
        age 20 and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times, remaining a prominent presence 
        in bodybuilding and writing many books and articles on the sport. The Arnold Sports Festival,

        as well as the sport's most charismatic ambassador.[4]
