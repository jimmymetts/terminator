                <h2>The Terminator</h2>
                
                <p> The Terminator is a 1984 American science-fiction action film[6][7][8][9] directed by James Cameron. 
                    It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cyborg assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 
                    to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose son will one day become a savior against machines in a 
                    post-apocalyptic future</p>
                <blockquote> "The Terminator topped the United States box office for two weeks and helped launch Cameron's 
                        film career and solidify Schwarzenegger's career."
                </blockquote>
                    <p>In 1984 Los Angeles, a cyborg assassin known as a Terminator arrives from 2029 and steals clothes and guns. 
                       Shortly afterward, Kyle Reese, a human soldier sent back in time from the same year, arrives. He steals 
                       clothes and weapons and evades the police. The Terminator begins systematically killing women named Sarah Connor, 
                       whose addresses it finds in the telephone directory. It tracks the last Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle 
                       rescues her. The pair steal a car and escape with the Terminator pursuing them in a police car.

                    <p>
                        The Terminator kills Sarah's mother and impersonates her when Sarah, unaware of the Terminator's ability 
                        to mimic voices, attempts to contact her via telephone. When they realize it has reacquired them, they 
                        escape in a pickup truck while it chases them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Kyle is wounded by 
                        gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Enragedâ€š Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle
                        but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah, 
                        but Kyle slides a pipe bomb onto the tanker's exhaust pipe, causing an explosion that burns the flesh from the 
                        Terminator's endoskeleton. It pursues them into a factory, where Kyle activates machinery to confuse the Terminator. 
                        He jams his final pipe bomb into the Terminator's abdomen, blowing it apart, injuring Sarah, and killing himself. 
                        The Terminator's torso reactivates and grabs Sarah. She breaks free and lures it into a hydraulic press, crushing it.

                        <h2>Development</h2>
                        
                         <p>In Rome, Italy, during the release of Piranha II: The Spawning, director Cameron fell ill and had a dream about 
                            a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion.[12] Inspired by director John Carpenter, 
                            who had made the slasher film Halloween (1978) on a low budget, Cameron used the dream as a "launching pad" to write 
                             a slasher-style film.[13] Cameron's agent disliked the Terminator concept and requested that he work on something else. 
                            After this, Cameron dismissed his agent.[14]
                         </p>
                         <p>The initial outline of the script involved two Terminators being sent to the past. The first was similar to the 
                             Terminator in the film, while the second was made of liquid metal and could not be destroyed with conventional weaponry.
